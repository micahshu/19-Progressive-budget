# PWA Budget Tracker

## Description
For this project we were given starter code and required to add functionality to the existing application so that a user can add expenses and deposits to their overall budget with or without an internet connection.
The user will be able to enter transactions offline that will then populate once they are back online. 

## Installation

The following packages need to be run through the CLI using NPM install. 

    * Mongoose
    * Morgan
